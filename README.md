# EVE Settings Manager (v2)

A third-party tool for managing **local settings files** for EVE Online.

Forked and extended from [mintnick/eve-settings-manager](https://github.com/mintnick/eve-settings-manager) (MIT).

## What this fork adds

- Dark themed UI
- Character ↔ account **linking**
- **Groups** of characters with a template char
- “Apply Group” and “Apply Links” flows
- Auto-link based on recent settings writes
- Help window with step-by-step instructions

This tool only manipulates **local profile/settings files**. Nothing more, nothing less.
